# Data Structures and Algorithms in Java and JavaScript

This repository is a comprehensive collection of implementations for various data structures and algorithms in both Java and JavaScript. It serves as a resource for learning and applying data structures and algorithmic techniques in both languages, with a range of examples and practical applications.

## Projects

The repository is organized into two main directories:

### DSA_Java
Here you'll find Java implementations of classic data structures and algorithms, along with advanced concepts such as:
- Advanced Recursion
- Binary Search Trees
- Dynamic Programming
- Graph Algorithms
- And many more.

Each subdirectory contains source code, examples, and explanatory notes that provide a deep dive into the intricacies of each concept.

### DSA_JavaScript
In this directory, JavaScript takes the center stage with projects including:
- JavaScriptSudokuSolver: A Sudoku solver implemented in JavaScript.
- Parsing_JSON_Data: Examples of how to parse JSON data using JavaScript.
- FizzBuzz, Fibonacci sequences, and various sorting algorithms.

This section also includes utility functions and data structure implementations that are commonly used in web development and JavaScript programming.
